				a large portion of consumers willing to spend extra money for a good pair. Features such as
				wireless connectivity and active noise cancelling have increased their integrity in society.
				However, many consumers seem to be unaware of what makes a headphone sound good. This
				article explores the science of frequency responses, what makes the “ideal” sound, and how
				the consumer headphone market deviates from established standards.</p></div> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-zbob2f">Understanding “Neutral” Frequency Response</h2> <p>Frequency response is determined by placing the headphone on a head and torso simulator (HATS)
			and measuring the amplitude of every frequency played. This is plotted on a graph and compared
			against targets such as Diffuse Field, which simulates the conditions of an ideal room to
			determine how sound travels within the room (<a href="#ref-1" class="reference-link svelte-884mjv">Silver, 2024a</a>) This allows for headphones to easily be compared to each other (<a href="#ref-1" class="reference-link svelte-884mjv">Olive, 2022</a>). The hearing range can be split into three main categories: Bass, Mid-range, and Treble (<a href="#ref-1" class="reference-link svelte-884mjv">McCuaig, 2023</a>;
			<a href="#ref-2" class="reference-link svelte-884mjv">Olive, 2022</a>). A neutral sound profile is one where all frequencies sound equally balanced, as it is
			intended to be heard by audio engineers (<a href="#ref-1" class="reference-link svelte-884mjv">McCuaig, 2023</a>). Due to how sound interacts with our anatomy, a neutral sound is highly individual. This is
			referred to as a head-related transfer function (HRTF); everyone has a different HRTF (<a href="#ref-4" class="reference-link svelte-884mjv">Silver, 2024a</a>).</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-15zxm6f">Target Curves</h2> <p>Many tests have been conducted to determine what most consumers would consider to be the
			“ideal” sound. Averages of these tests have been plotted to determine a target frequency
			response, known as a target curve. Most research for over-ear headphones has been conducted
			for Harman by Dr. Sean Olive and is recognised as the “Harman target,” with many iterations
			since its first introduction in 2013 (<a href="#ref-4" class="reference-link svelte-884mjv">Silver, 2024a</a>).</p> <p>Tests are primarily conducted using two methods: allowing test participants to try multiple
			headphones with different sound profiles or allowing them to alter the sound in an app and
			rating the sound, with a higher number being better (<a href="#ref-3" class="reference-link svelte-884mjv">Olive et al., 2017</a>).</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-u46lgc">Sound Signatures</h2> <p>Many consumers find neutral sound boring and prefer a coloured sound deviating from the audio
			engineer’s intentions. Common sound signatures are bass-heavy, V-shaped, and treble-heavy (<a href="#ref-1" class="reference-link svelte-884mjv">McCuaig, 2023</a>). A bass-heavy sound has significantly boosted bass, resulting in a thumpy, boomy sound at
			the expense of clarity if the boost extends into the mid-range, referred to as sounding “warm”
			(<a href="#ref-1" class="reference-link svelte-884mjv">McCuaig, 2023</a>). A V-shaped sound signature is one where both the bass and treble are boosted, resulting in
			a “V-shaped” graph. This results in an exciting sound where you still get extra thump and
			rumble without the qualities of treble being lost in the mix, at the expense of the mid-range
			almost disappearing (<a href="#ref-1" class="reference-link svelte-884mjv">McCuaig, 2023</a>). A treble-boosted sound enhances detail at the expense of sounding piercing and fatiguing,
			preferred by many as it reveals flaws in music and compensates for age-related hearing loss (<a href="#ref-1" class="reference-link svelte-884mjv">McCuaig, 2023</a>;
			<a href="#ref-2" class="reference-link svelte-884mjv">Olive, 2022</a>). This type of sound is known as being “bright.”</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-q6stom">Why Frequency Response Graphs Aren’t Flat</h2> <p>Almost all charts will have a bump in the treble region, referred to as “ear gain.” This
			represents the region of frequencies that are naturally amplified by the pinna, so that higher
			frequency sounds, such as speech, can be better understood (<a href="#ref-1" class="reference-link svelte-884mjv">Headphones.com, 2022</a>).</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-dgg45l">Evaluating the current state of the headphone market</h2> <p>Table 1 consists of the most popular over-ear headphones based on a list of the most popular
			headphone brands in the US and their flagship consumer headphone (<a href="#ref-1" class="reference-link svelte-884mjv">Bashir, 2024</a>). This was done as sales data on specific models is scarce.</p> <div class="headphone-table svelte-884mjv" data-svelte-h="svelte-1czfk4t"><h3>Table 1: List of popular Headphones</h3> <table class="svelte-884mjv"><thead><tr class="svelte-884mjv"><th class="svelte-884mjv">Brand</th> <th class="svelte-884mjv">Model</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr class="svelte-884mjv"><td class="svelte-884mjv">Apple</td> <td class="svelte-884mjv">AirPods Max</td></tr> <tr class="svelte-884mjv"><td class="svelte-884mjv">Beats</td> <td class="svelte-884mjv">Solo 4</td></tr> <tr class="svelte-884mjv"><td class="svelte-884mjv">Sony</td> <td class="svelte-884mjv">WH-1000XM5</td></tr> <tr class="svelte-884mjv"><td class="svelte-884mjv">JBL</td> <td class="svelte-884mjv">Tour One M2</td></tr> <tr class="svelte-884mjv"><td class="svelte-884mjv">Bose</td> <td class="svelte-884mjv">QC Ultra</td></tr></tbody></table></div> <figure style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;"><img src="/conference/_app/immutable/assets/figure1.BbFZmXea.png" alt="Figure 1" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;"> <figcaption style="font-style: italic; color: #555; margin-top: 10px;">Figure 1: FR Charts for popular headphones</figcaption></figure> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-uz832u">Figure 1 presents a comparison chart from the community run database squig.link.

			The contributor has not stated which HATS is used, though they have measured 4/5 of the

			bass boost. On their own, these measurements don&#39;t reveal much about their sound compared to a
			neutral reference. Due to limitations, I will compare the Sony WH-1000XM5 to the Sennheiser HD
			600, renowned for its neutral tuning and sub-bass roll-off, which closely follows the Harman
			2018 linear target.</p> <figure style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;"><img src="/conference/_app/immutable/assets/figure2.DO7FXr0P.png" alt="Figure 2" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;"> <figcaption style="font-style: italic; color: #555; margin-top: 10px;">Figure 2: XM5 vs HD 600</figcaption></figure> <figure style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;"><img src="/conference/_app/immutable/assets/figure3.TZlWIdAV.png" alt="Figure 3" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;"> <figcaption style="font-style: italic; color: #555; margin-top: 10px;">Figure 3: HD 600 vs Harman OE 2018 Linear</figcaption></figure> <p>As seen in Figure 2 &amp; 3, the XM5 has a notable bass boost while having a recessed mid-range
			but similar treble to the HD 600. This results in a sound that is boomy, bloated, and lacking
			in clarity. The recession in the mid-range is done to create a sense of space in the
			headphone; however, this comes at the expense of vocal clarity (<a href="#ref-8" class="reference-link svelte-884mjv">Silver, 2024b</a>).</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-yppvoz">Given this information, we can assume that the other headphones are simply different amounts
			of the same problem, and we can conclude that most consumer headphones are significantly bass
			boosted. However, this directly contradicts the research done by Harman and Dr Sean Olive to
			determine consumer preference.</p> <figure style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;"><img src="/conference/_app/immutable/assets/figure4.DAuICdnv.png" alt="Figure 4" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;"> <figcaption style="font-style: italic; color: #555; margin-top: 10px;">Figure 4: Airpods Max vs Harman OE 2018</figcaption></figure> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1nap3i1">The least bass boosted headphone in the table, the Airpods Max, still exceeds the target and
			the treble is significantly reduced.</p> <p>Many companies prefer this tuning style as it sounds less fatiguing due to fewer perceivable
			details. Another reason is Dr. Dre&#39;s promotion of bass as the main headphone quality. Beats&#39;
			success stems from cheap earphones lacking bass, leading consumers to associate bass with
			higher quality (<a href="#ref-3" class="reference-link svelte-884mjv">Izundu, 2014</a>).</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-grw4hp">Conclusion</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1qg0nio">There is a disconnect between scientific research and the actual tuning of consumer
			headphones. Research suggests that most listeners will prefer a neutral or slightly v shaped
			sound when given the choice; the market still seems to be dominated by bass boosted sound
			signatures. This results in more consumers associating excessive bass with audio quality and
			allows manufacturers to make clarity improvements every year by slightly reducing the boost –
			making consumers waste money on new headphones.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1l7e9g7">As the headphone market continues to evolve, manufacturers may eventually lean towards more
			scientifically correct tunings. Until then, consumers seeking accurate sound will have to cope
			with audiophile/HiFi offerings.</p> <div id="ppt" class="svelte-884mjv" data-svelte-h="svelte-1ua0f1x"><h2>Presentation</h2> <video src="/conference/_app/immutable/assets/ppt.AnfIUPR6.mp4" controls class="svelte-884mjv"></video></div> <div class="reference-list svelte-884mjv"><h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-1v9xib0">References</h2> <ul class="svelte-884mjv"><li id="ref-1" class="reference-item svelte-884mjv"><a href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/997153/most-used-headphones-by-brand-in-the-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="reference-text svelte-884mjv">Bashir, U.
